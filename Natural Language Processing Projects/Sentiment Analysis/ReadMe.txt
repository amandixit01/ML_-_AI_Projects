Text Analysis project:

In this project I have performed Sentiment analysis on articles posted by Blackcoffer. Using a list of URLs of Webpages,I extracted the content through Beautiful Soup and analyzed it using Python libraries like NLTK.

Final output consists of several variables for each URL like posivtive score, negative score, Polarity score , subjectivity score , etc.

->The output file however doesn’t contains value for few of the URLs, that is because of the problem in scraping, I tried changing class names and customizing code for specific classes in url, but the code was still not able to scrap specifically from those URLs, so I left ‘em as it is.

->The output contains various variables as can be seen in Output Data Structure.

->I utilized Jupyter Notebook in this project, and have uploaded it with the name Text Analysis.
