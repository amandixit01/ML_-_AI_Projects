Text Analysis project:
->I have attached .py and excel output files.

->In completing the given task I used BeautifulSoup for web scrapping purpose. 

->Other libraries I used for performing the given task include – openpyxl , pandas , nltk, etc.

->The output file however doesn’t contains value for few of the URLs, that is because of problem in scraping, I tried changing class names and customizing code for specific classes in url, but the code was still not able to scrap specifically from those URLs, so I left ‘em as it is.

->The output contains all the variables as mentioned in Output Data Structure.

->I utilized Jupyter Notebook to perform the given task, and downloaded the file in.py format.
